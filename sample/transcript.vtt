Scott Thompson: Alright. Okay, so it is recording. But I'm gonna go upstairs and see if I can dump the other stuff.

2
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:17.519

Andrew Henshaw: Thank you.

4
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.710
Andrew Henshaw: Okay.

5
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.110
Scott Thompson: yeah.

6
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.080
Scott Thompson: okay, we are working.

7
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.090
Scott Thompson: They're not.

8
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.180
mary: Oh.

9
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.830
Scott Thompson: oh.

10
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.540
about.

11
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.490
Scott Thompson: think we got a full house? No.

12
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.330
Andrew Henshaw: let's see

13
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.559
Andrew Henshaw: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Yeah, that's right.

14
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.529
Scott Thompson: So we're gonna get today.

15
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.610
Scott Thompson: Let me know when you all want to get started. We have right on the number.

16
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.659
Andrew Henshaw: because all 6 people I'm ready.

17
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.469
Scott Thompson: Alright. This meeting is called to order.

18
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:15.599
Scott Thompson:  we did. We got a roll call. So do we want to approve the November minutes. That was the last one that has not been approved yet. Right?

19
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.040
Andrew Henshaw: Right?

20
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.560
Scott Smith: We have a second. I read Urban

21
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.710
Scott Smith: Andrew.

22
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.149
Andrew Henshaw: I'm sorry

23
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.630
Scott Smith: I read every line. Oh, good. Yeah. Yeah.

24
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.319
Andrew Henshaw: Yeah. What? 58 pages or something.

25
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:41.630
Scott Smith: It's a good way for people not to read it to record it. Yeah.

26
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.609
Scott Thompson: alright. So those mu minutes have been approved, though, let's get started here.

27
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.289
Scott Smith: We have an open seat, as you all know.

28
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:59.289
Scott Thompson: and we could either circle back to the 2 or 3 names that were applying to getting on the board way back when

29
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.860
Scott Thompson: or we could look for somebody to put up on the board. We have a lot of stuff we want to get done this year.

30
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:18.260
Scott Thompson: and it seems like between the 3 of us, 4 of us that are on the board living here. We're getting a lot done. So do we? Wanna try to recruit somebody that lives here?

31
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:28.130
Scott Smith: I like the idea. I like the idea of somebody here, if that's possible, reach out to everybody that's here.

32
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.730
Scott Thompson: Do we have to post this position, or can we just make a decision?

33
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.169
Bo Fridh: Good question? I don't know legally what's required. I think posting it. Giving people a chance to.

34
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.729
Bo Fridh: you know. Throw the hat in the ring. Might be good.

35
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:58.239
Scott Thompson: Can we tell them the on the post that we put out the importance of being a permanent resident, that we want to be a proactive, get things on hands on board.

36
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.000
Scott Thompson: Why not? Okay.

37
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.530
Scott Thompson: yeah, I will.

38
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.270
Scott Thompson: Why don't I? Draft a

39
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:15.770
Scott Thompson: like a little resume thing for this weekend? And we'll have people that would say, we're gonna cut it off by February first.

40
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.460
Andrew Henshaw: Yeah. Say, just for the minutes while we have a vacancy.

41
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.020
Scott Thompson: Linda Alcawa resigned.

42
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.780
Andrew Henshaw: Okay.

43
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.089
Scott Thompson: okay, so I'll get to work on that, and I'll shoot out a

44
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:54.390
Scott Thompson: just a quick short. So post before we post it. We'll make sure it looks good, and then we'll send it to Andrew to put out on probably an email or valera

45
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.100
Scott Thompson: with a date on it.

46
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:06.210
Andrew Henshaw: Yeah, send it out as an email. So what if you sent it out with the email with the

47
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.300
Scott Thompson: recommended vendor list that we all know at the

48
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.680
Scott Thompson: kill 2 birds with one stone. Okay?

49
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.150
Scott Smith: I think that's really good idea, because we we want people who want to be on the board.

50
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.160
So.

51
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:29.510
Scott Thompson: and we don't want them to know the importance of living here versus what we're trying to get done

52
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.820
Scott Smith:  okay, so what else we got.

53
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.550
Scott Thompson: what does everybody feel about getting a newsletter.

54
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:48.509
Scott Thompson: I'll start writing down some things that we get done along the way, and we'll put a newsletter out in March. That'd be we're gonna try to do once a quarter.

55
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:57.230
Scott Smith: That sounds like a good idea, Scottie. I've gotten good feedback from different people who stop me on the street.

56
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.429
Scott Smith: It's kind of.

57
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:06.100
Scott Thompson: Okay. So we're what we're gonna do is we're gonna compile a maybe once a month we'll I'll put a

58
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:14.109
Scott Thompson: sheet together of what we've been getting done and what we're talking about there basically be a breakdown of a recap of the meeting bullet points.

59
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.620
Scott Thompson: We'll try to get that out in March.

60
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.770
Scott Thompson: Let's see, did anybody get a chance to look at the the picture that I sent out would be

61
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.410
Scott Thompson: street sign.

62
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.590
Andrew Henshaw: Yeah, it's awesome.

63
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.689
mary: Yes, sir.

64
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.810
Scott Thompson: So if everybody is in agreement on that, I'm gonna try to get the company to give us a price.

65
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.560
Scott Thompson: Because if you look at every cross street

66
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.270
Scott Thompson: has 2 raggedy posts

67
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:53.390
Scott Thompson: and this would accomplish. Kill 2 birds of one stone it would give us the crossroads.

68
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.110
Scott Thompson: It would give us the stop signs

69
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:12.900
Scott Thompson: and I talked to building Purvis this week. and he said that it needs to be a certain type assignment for the city needs to be. Have a breakaway system on it in case somebody hits it.

70
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:20.130
Scott Thompson: So I'll make sure that this company is that gives us a bit of certified to Make sure we get the proper

71
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.729
Scott Thompson: street signed to be in compliance with the the county.

72
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:39.990
Scott Thompson: so do do we all agree on pursuing this. It's a metal post. Well, it'll never rot and fall over like they do in a lot of communities after 8 or 10 years. Let's do it right the first time and get a good bid on it.

73
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.980
Scott Thompson: Okay, so I'll pursue that, and I'll

74
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:52.580
Scott Thompson: but the next meeting I'll have something shout out to you with a with a price on it.

75
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.220
Scott Thompson: Okay.

76
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.340
Scott Thompson: Bo. Do you want to tell us any good things that are going on the the front gate? And

77
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.340
Scott Thompson: I saw you put out a report on with the

78
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.410
Scott Thompson: phone numbers. I mean the with what you've created.

79
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:20.210
Bo Fridh: Yeah. So there, Billy and I kicked around a couple of options for

80
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.349
Bo Fridh: the sign, the the keypad that's out there.

81
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:34.710
Bo Fridh: There's something, Linda, and this goes back to something. Linda brought up a concern that some folks wouldn't want to have their address listed

82
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:50.480
Bo Fridh: on that directory. We kind of ruled out the idea going with names, but it seems to make sense if we put list the residents their actual street address. All the other folks that just have lots put the lot numbers and have it

83
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:55.779
Bo Fridh: in order numerically. So when somebody shows up, if they want to go to.

84
00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:03.010
Bo Fridh: My house, for instance. If they don't have the code, they just push my street address. If it's a delivery person.

85
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.390
Bo Fridh: they're certainly gonna know what address they're going to. We'll have

86
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.210
Bo Fridh: the

87
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.440
Bo Fridh: app available for

88
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:23.250
Bo Fridh: people, so that when somebody pushes that street address. Whoever lives there. They're gonna get a little thing that pops up on the phone saying, you gotta sell gate

89
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.000
Bo Fridh: action for you.

90
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:31.789
Bo Fridh: You click on it and accept. You see who it is. You can push the button momentarily. Open the gate. Let them in.

91
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:41.819
Andrew Henshaw: I'm I'm sorry something is going screw. Are you all saying this? My screen share. Still.

92
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.840
Scott Thompson: no, no.

93
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:51.650
Andrew Henshaw: okay. I've been trying to cancel the screen share. and it refuses to

94
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.970
Andrew Henshaw: do so.

95
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:58.150
Andrew Henshaw: Oh, yeah. system is very much

96
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.269
Andrew Henshaw: confused. Hold on

97
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:10.079
Scott Smith: so it wouldn't help that. Our names. Is that what you're saying? Bo.

98
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:16.790
Bo Fridh: Yes, I mean, you got a choice, because the limitation on characters can either have a name or an address.

99
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:24.150
Bo Fridh: And we're thinking from the perspective of delivery drivers, they're more interested in, you know, going to a specific address

100
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.170
Scott Thompson: right?

101
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.840
Bo Fridh: There are some folks who don't want to have their name displayed.

102
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:41.150
Bo Fridh: Oh, I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't want to have your address displayed, because there's no no name associated with. It's just basically for somebody visiting you. If you haven't given the No code, mostly delivery

103
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.490
Bo Fridh: furniture delivery, whatever.

104
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:51.079
mary: That'd be better for 9 1 one call as well. For some reason, you know, they had to look at the Directory.

105
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.230
Bo Fridh: True.

106
00:11:54.710 --> 00:12:01.759
Bo Fridh: we're good. Well, for 9, 1 one calls We're required to let the sheriff's department know, and and

107
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:09.319
Bo Fridh:  probably, and maybe in Seneca police I don't know. But we have to provide a 9 1 one access code

108
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.809
Bo Fridh: for all emergency personnel.

109
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.890
Scott Smith: Okay, that's good.

110
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:28.809
Bo Fridh:  so I think I was, I was at a point where they'll have access basically to just open a gate momentarily when somebody presses, you know, selects their name and and presses that

111
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:42.600
Bo Fridh: they don't have access to do anything else within that cell gate system that we're using. And just to let you know cell gate is about as user, friendly as polar. It's a pain in the ass from an administration perspective.

112
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:47.009
Bo Fridh: But from the user perspective, we get folks set up with this. It shouldn't be a big deal.

113
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:52.769
Bo Fridh: Also be able to do is when somebody presses their location. It's gonna pop up on their phone.

114
00:12:52.820 --> 00:13:04.610
Bo Fridh: Billy and I get this all the time now, because folks that go up there, and Billy's names on there. I'm on there. I don't know what else is there but like probably 1520 times a day between the 2 of us.

115
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:18.469
Bo Fridh: We have to get on into around the phone doing something. Or if you just get the notification on the phone, you look at us a Selegate thing. We click on it. We can see who's there. They can tell us where they're going, and we hit the open gate button.

116
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:26.320
Bo Fridh: What is that the business of doing that? How is that going to your landline? Or is that going to your cell phone?

117
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.940
Bo Fridh: I have no landline.

118
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.379
Scott Thompson: right? Nobody does.

119
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:35.279
Bo Fridh: Yeah. Now, that's strictly to the cell phone. Yeah. Cause on a landline. You're not gonna see who's there?

120
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.180
Scott Thompson: Right?

121
00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.980
Bo Fridh: The the second option that was on there was

122
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.579
Bo Fridh: was basically to let people opt out.

123
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:56.669
Bo Fridh: And the more we, Billy and I kick it around the less we like that idea, because then we're what we'd have to do is tell the folks that listen. If you don't want to be on there, and you've got a delivery

124
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.970
Bo Fridh: once we've got the system fully implemented.

125
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:11.820
Bo Fridh: They got no way to get in, because if they call me, you know, if they just start going down the list of addresses and pressing buttons. We're gonna tell folks if you don't know who it is they're not coming to. You don't open the gate.

126
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:21.770
Bo Fridh: and obviously, if the person decides well, just hang out a bit. Wait till somebody leaves or somebody else is coming in. They have that option, but

127
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:33.290
Bo Fridh: you know the the security is is limited at best in terms of what we can provide. What we did was, if you found that spreadsheet screenshot I had

128
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:46.120
Bo Fridh: have it set up with a phase 1, 2, and 3. Phase one is Harbor Point Road, and and the roads off of that. and what we do is is use their lot numbers. So the codes will be pretty simple. We're gonna assign codes.

129
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:54.130
Bo Fridh: So for somebody who's on, let's say, Lot 35, they're gonna have 1 0 3, 5, because they're in phase one.

130
00:14:54.710 --> 00:15:03.360
Bo Fridh: So we do that phase 2 would be quite pine road, and the roads off of that the 3 cul de sacs off of that that would be.

131
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.910
Bo Fridh: Whatever the lot number is. Scott, what's your lot? Number

132
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.190
Scott Thompson: 28,

133
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:13.109
Bo Fridh: what is it? No, no, Scott Smith, Scott Smith.

134
00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.030
Bo Fridh: 75. So Scott would be in phase 2. He'd be 2 0 7 5,

135
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:29.300
Bo Fridh: because he's in phase 2. Then phase 3 would be Harbor Point Road, and everything there would start with 3, and if somebody's on like say, lot 1, 22, they'd be 3, 1, 2, 2,

136
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:38.739
Bo Fridh: one of the nice things about that is, there's no no combination of the phase, or a lot number that would be 2012, or 2020. So

137
00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:42.610
Bo Fridh: we can get rid of those numbers. It's not going to impact anybody that's here.

138
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.659
Bo Fridh: The burden is going to be on folks to let their you know.

139
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:53.610
Bo Fridh: Their friends know their relatives know, or whatever what the gate code is, or

140
00:15:54.420 --> 00:16:06.000
Bo Fridh: they're going to be on that board if they live here and be able to answer that if they don't live here, let's say they're I don't know. They've got somebody coming out to to give a quote on clearing the land.

141
00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:13.669
Bo Fridh: whatever. Even with that, if they push the lot. what's a vacant lot? Number lots 29.

142
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:20.239
Bo Fridh: Now say, lot 32, it's going to go to whoever owns Lot 32, and they can let the person in.

143
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:28.949
Scott Thompson: And you're gonna plug in this cell phone numbers out of a directory.

144
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:36.559
Bo Fridh: I think I got a screenshot I had there. You know we have most cell numbers for folks. Not all, but most

145
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:44.150
Bo Fridh: there. There's some quirky things or properties been sold since we first started doing this. So there's different owners, that kind of stuff. But

146
00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.619
Bo Fridh: it'll it'll be a work in progress.

147
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:56.659
Scott Thompson: So if you need cell phone numbers. I've got almost 50 of them that I've collected with this. the bush hugging.

148
00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:01.370
Bo Fridh: Well, we've got most of this stuff just off off of Polara.

149
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:07.209
Bo Fridh: So we've got, I'd say, out of the 150, or whatever lots we have, we've probably got a

150
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.540
Bo Fridh: 135 identified and or 130

151
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:17.339
Scott Thompson: alright circle back to me. If you you want me to send bush because I have their email addresses

152
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.050
Scott Thompson: lot numbering in cell phone number. If you're missing, honey.

153
00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:26.220
Bo Fridh: Okay, I'll let you know anybody have any any concerns about

154
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:31.369
Scott Thompson: what we're looking at doing. No, I think it's a great great step forward

155
00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:44.819
Bo Fridh: question is, how soon do we wanna roll it out until we get everybody assigned and and the information out to everybody. We can't get rid of 2012 and 2020.

156
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.770
jb_ad: Well, is there a way that that like data will be collected or can be collected on.

157
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.699
jb_ad: you know who's going in and out, and and all that.

158
00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:55.710
Bo Fridh: Yep.

159
00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:03.979
Bo Fridh: that's that's all captured by by the app. It's called Cellgate. So that's all captured on there. So you'll be able to tell when

160
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:10.269
Bo Fridh: well, if one thing I didn't mention, somebody's going to be building a lot, let's say lot

161
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.439
Bo Fridh: 100 and 13, or whatever they're going to build.

162
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:25.249
Bo Fridh: They're down in Harbor Ridge, so their their gate number would be 3, 1, 1, 3. What we do is as soon as they tell us they're going to build is give them

163
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:36.290
Bo Fridh: probably just put a 9 as the first number 9, 1, 1, 3. That would be the number they would give to their general contractor for their general contractor to disseminate to their subcontractors.

164
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:44.790
Bo Fridh: and if if they show up and they don't have that number again. We're going to tell other folks. Don't let somebody in if you don't know who it is, or if they're coming to you.

165
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:50.550
Bo Fridh: and then, once the construction is done, we would just take that 9, 1, 1, 3 out of the system.

166
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.490
jb_ad: but 2012 and 2020 are still gonna be

167
00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.870
jb_ad: access for ups or

168
00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:57.930
Bo Fridh: no.

169
00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:04.270
mary: we're gonna let. We're gonna let. No, it's gonna get to the point where ups if they don't know.

170
00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.860
Bo Fridh: they they need to be able to

171
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.170
Bo Fridh: press the button on the Directory to get lead in.

172
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:18.839
Bo Fridh: The the whole idea is to get rid of the standardized numbers that everybody in the brother can pass around to each other. Homeowner give

173
00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:34.390
Scott Thompson: ups or Fedex their access code based off the what you're gonna plug into their lap number. And absolutely. Yeah. If if you, as a homeowner, want to let ups know that, hey? When you come to deliver to me, here's here's the access code perfect.

174
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:38.949
Bo Fridh: That's fine. And then, obviously, they can use that number for anybody. But

175
00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.619
Scott Thompson: so we had done.

176
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:52.400
Bo Fridh: That's that's a problem where there's there's, you know, in terms of what percentage of security we're getting out of this 50%, maybe.

177
00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:02.960
Andrew Henshaw: Can you change the the shareable access code? Or automatically, you know, like every

178
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:09.759
Andrew Henshaw: couple of months that you know that everybody shareable code would would

179
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.390
Andrew Henshaw: have to be changed. It would be automatically changed, and they would get a new one.

180
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.139
Bo Fridh: What do you mean by shareable code?

181
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.630
Andrew Henshaw: So don't. Is it gonna be that everybody's gonna have 2 codes?

182
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.670
Andrew Henshaw: One is like a permanent one and another one would be shareable.

183
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:41.610
Andrew Henshaw: No, you're gonna have your code, if you can share that with wherever you want to. Would it be possible? What's that? Would it be possible to do that? To give everybody you know this is your code. This is your one that you give to delivery people.

184
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:47.350
Andrew Henshaw: and then the delivery. One could be changed or would be changed regularly.

185
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:48.840
Scott Thompson: The same thing right?

186
00:20:48.940 --> 00:21:00.280
Andrew Henshaw: That sounds like an administrator, the one that you use all the time you'd like, you know, not have to. you know, constantly have that one, but the one that you would give out to somebody just because they're gonna deliver pizza or something like that.

187
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:10.750
Andrew Henshaw: You don't want that to be sticking around for very long. No, but again, the idea is, you don't get in the code. They show up, they press your address. You let them in. They don't need a code.

188
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:17.750
Bo Fridh: Okay, yeah, we we want to limit to the extent. That's a whole idea with going with this thing and not letting people opt out.

189
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:29.699
Bo Fridh: so that when they've got somebody coming to them. you know, if you don't want to give them if they don't want to give them a code. You don't things like construction. When you got a Gc. Coming for 9 months, 10 months, 12 months.

190
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:36.449
Bo Fridh: They don't need to be punching the button every time they would get their construction code for the duration of the construction.

191
00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:46.800
Andrew Henshaw: Well, it just seems like. It would be nice to to be able to have a temporary code that you could give out.

192
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:53.550
Andrew Henshaw: You know, cause you've got somebody that's coming and staying with you, but you don't want to let them have your code

193
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:54.690
Andrew Henshaw: forever.

194
00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:01.389
Andrew Henshaw: And if it was, and if there is, and if it's not a big a cost or something like that associated with it.

195
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:06.580
Andrew Henshaw: I would think, if it's just a matter of the system providing it.

196
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:12.310
Bo Fridh: It's not a matter of the system providing it. It's a matter of Mere Billy

197
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:15.690
Bo Fridh: taking the time to go through and change all of them.

198
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:22.210
Scott Thompson: Oh, I think it'd be helpful if Andrew is up to speed on, Andrew. What we're working on is we're getting a bid on

199
00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.730
Scott Thompson: Live Security cameras

200
00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:33.600
Scott Thompson: to be put at the front entrance so it'll catch cars going in and coming out. Yeah. So if there is anything where somebody

201
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.850
Scott Thompson: keys in a number and gets in.

202
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:46.500
Scott Thompson: it may not be, we'll catch him instantly, but we will be able to roll the cameras back and attach a crime to a license plate.

203
00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.520
Andrew Henshaw: Okay, yeah.

204
00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.049
Scott Thompson: And Bo, where do we stand? Is that guy getting back to you with a bit at all?

205
00:22:52.530 --> 00:23:00.530
Bo Fridh: Well, you're supposed to send you and me a quote. I'm going to guess you haven't gotten it, either.

206
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.220
Bo Fridh: Yeah, he said. He'd have it to us. I think last week that's what I thought.

207
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:14.149
Scott Thompson: I'll give him a jingle. He's looking for some business, so I'm sure he's hopefully he's working on sourcing it.

208
00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:19.489
Bo Fridh: Okay, he was out there. He was out there looking at it, so I know he's on site. So

209
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:27.940
mary: are those just cameras only, or is there any monitoring through that company that they do?

210
00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.640
Scott Thompson: He was gonna give us 2 options. Right? Bo.

211
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:41.689
Bo Fridh: Well, he he said, the option of having monitoring and stuff he goes, I can tell you, for a development decides it's gonna be cost prohibitive.

212
00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.730
Scott Thompson: Right?

213
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:50.789
Scott Thompson: Alright. Let's let's see what he gives us, and then we'll we'll put it out to the group for

214
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.850
Scott Thompson: discussion.

215
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.170
Bo Fridh: Okay.

216
00:23:54.070 --> 00:24:00.630
Scott Thompson: so Andrew is gonna put out a post with the the open board seat.

217
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.820
Scott Thompson: Soon he's gonna post the

218
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:13.320
Scott Thompson: recommended vendors. Beau, could you have him post the proper gate clickers to buy for your

219
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.710
Scott Thompson: cars. Yeah.

220
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.779
Scott Thompson: So what would that be? It's a liftmaster, something 800 or whatever.

221
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.670
Bo Fridh: Yeah, I'll I'll

222
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.980
Bo Fridh: What's your cell number. Andrew.

223
00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.859
Bo Fridh: you're on mute. Yeah, you're on mute.

224
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.770
Okay?

225
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:40.049
Andrew Henshaw: Sorry about that. Aren't good. Yeah. 4, 4, 7, 1, 7,

226
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.810
Andrew Henshaw: 4, 1, 8, one.

227
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.419
Bo Fridh: 7, 1, 7, 4, 1, 8, one.

228
00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:49.540
Bo Fridh: Okay, I'm gonna send you a picture of the front and the back

229
00:24:49.720 --> 00:25:02.360
Bo Fridh: of the actual lift master thing. It's got the code on and stuff. So people order the right thing. We just need to stress that doing a knock off of something that says equivalent to it's not gonna work

230
00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:04.449
Scott Thompson: went through 2 rounds of that.

231
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:12.969
Scott Thompson: And I think they're probably the same amount of money, too. It's just a matter of knowing which one proper one.

232
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.350
Bo Fridh: It's exactly

233
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:20.850
Scott Thompson: okay. You got anything else, though. Cause I wanna add one more thing to the front gate.

234
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.600
Scott Thompson: Mike, is it? Your neighbor Ed?

235
00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:31.829
Scott Thompson: No, bob so Bob Mike and I met up front.

236
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:41.650
Scott Thompson: and we realize there is no way to get any power to the right side of the gate to to add lights or whatever a plug over there. So

237
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:50.079
Scott Thompson: probably about right about. Now we're going to look to on a warm weekend to rent a trencher.

238
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.959
Scott Thompson: We're gonna cut the road open by about like 3 inches.

239
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.310
Scott Thompson: and we're going to put a drop in a 2 inch pipe

240
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:11.560
Scott Thompson: that we can put a new line over to the other side of the gate. and then we're gonna seal it up. And we could also use that line to add another line to it down the road if we need it

241
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.090
Scott Thompson: right now. The the builder.

242
00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:22.370
Scott Thompson: whoever put the power to the right side of the gate. Put a line over there and a half inch line, and you cannot run another line to it.

243
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.790
Scott Thompson: Well, we're kind of screwed on

244
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:30.630
Scott Thompson: modifying cameras or Christmas lights, or whatever we want to do. They're also

245
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.079
Scott Thompson: Scott was pointing out to me that the lights are led.

246
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.289
Scott Thompson: and we want to be able to repair those on both sides of the gate.

247
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.670
Scott Smith: So I will. I will give it, Bob.

248
00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.089
Scott Thompson: and we'll find a weekend. We're gonna do that

249
00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.910
Scott Smith: one comment, Scott.

250
00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:58.120
Scott Smith: Oh, but when he's putting the plugin on the right side, put an extra plug in on the left side.

251
00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:06.879
Scott Smith: cause there there is power on the left side, but it's not convenient to plug anything into it, because it's occupied by

252
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:18.969
mary: yeah. Well.

253
00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:23.189
Scott Smith: well, there'll be 2 outlets on each side.

254
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:36.430
Scott Smith: and I did have one more question from Boe, did you? I think you asked a question, but I didn't hear the answer. Maybe you said if I didn't hear it. Wh? What? When are you gonna make these changes to the panel?

255
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.039
Scott Smith: It's a great idea. What? When is that gonna happen?

256
00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:46.930
Bo Fridh:  to be determined, I guess. How soon do we want to?

257
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:52.479
Scott Thompson: Let's try to go live with it by sometime in the first quarter. How's that for a goal.

258
00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:56.530
Bo Fridh: Okay with with all of them, or you want to roll it out in phases.

259
00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:06.660
Scott Thompson:  might as well do all of them. I would say, somebody who's living here, and all the lot, numbers and stuff might as well roll it out.

260
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.019
Bo Fridh: Andrew, that'd be something good to put in the

261
00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:18.839
Bo Fridh: Newsletter is that when we do this, the 2,012 and 2020 are gonna go away.

262
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.570
Bo Fridh: So I'll get with Billy. I'll get with Billy and and try to put something. That's

263
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:29.970
Bo Fridh:  The relatively succinct

264
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.560
Bo Fridh: contains the information on

265
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:39.280
Bo Fridh: how to get the or, you know, downloading the Sell Gate app, and what functionality individuals will have in terms of

266
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:42.469
Bo Fridh: their phone ringing and seeing this thing that, says Selegate on it.

267
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:50.010
Bo Fridh: Maybe some screenshots whatever to it's going to involve some training, but I mean, we've got to roll it out and

268
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:51.549
Bo Fridh: see what happens.

269
00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.529
Scott Smith: It'd be nice to have that in that first quarter newsletter. That that

270
00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:03.130
Bo Fridh: oh, yeah, you know. And we can 2020, 2012 around for a while. We can tell them it's going away immediately, but

271
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.260
Bo Fridh: we can keep it in place for a month or 2.

272
00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:11.779
Scott Thompson: It'd be nice to announce power with seasonal lighting up front led and

273
00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:19.310
Scott Thompson: Scott and I are gonna power. Wash the front entrance as soon as we get a warm weekend here and lot of good stuff.

274
00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:24.800
Scott Smith: Just one small maintenance

275
00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:29.679
Scott Smith: question trivial about what one place where we lived

276
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:33.999
Scott Smith: that had the same system. It everybody had their own code.

277
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:39.259
Scott Smith: and and when people sold their house there was never any maintenance to it.

278
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:45.630
Scott Smith: I could go into that development 5 years later, plug in my old code and still get in there.

279
00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:54.659
Scott Smith: And they I bet they had all kinds of cameras, too, though right? So the point is when somebody we use for

280
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:59.919
Scott Smith: Bowles team would need to be involved in the lupa. Erase those, sir. Codes.

281
00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:02.090
Scott Thompson: you know.

282
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.670
Bo Fridh: Yeah. True.

283
00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.029
Scott Thompson: Alrighty. Anything else to add to the the front gate

284
00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:20.309
Bo Fridh: the only thing I had throw in is this, this is kind of humorous. If anybody wants to go into towns, point next door. No, not Talents. Point. What's the hideaway cove?

285
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.849
mary: Pull up the gate and use use the same clicker. We have it all open our gate

286
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:30.150
mary: that's awesome.

287
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:34.740
Scott Smith: and then go inside. See if it works on their garage doors.

288
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.580
Scott Smith: Alright, I wanna

289
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:45.349
Scott Thompson: I wanna do a shout out here to Scott Smith. He's been doing a great job on the Treasury with Diane and

290
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.470
Scott Thompson: update the financials. And one of the

291
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:53.560
Scott Thompson: the best things that Scott's doing also is getting our collections up to date. So

292
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.719
Scott Thompson: got I appreciate the hard work.

293
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.509
Scott Smith: Thank you, my dogs.

294
00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.150
Scott Smith: Even the dog liked it.

295
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.280
Scott Thompson: So you put out a a report earlier?

296
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:28.860
Scott Smith: Yes, III put out the the 3 financial reports, and then 15 min before the meeting I sent Andrew, and then a copy. The rest of you just bullet points to make your minute writing simpler. II presume you'll will write it from the department.

297
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:34.889
Scott Smith: or is it? Are these gonna be recorded? No one. anyway?

298
00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:40.420
Scott Smith: Anyway. So is. Shall I go, Scott, your.

299
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:41.650
Scott Smith: it's my turn.

300
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.900
Scott Smith: Yeah, absolutely so. Just

301
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:57.739
Scott Smith: the the highlights. You can look at the financial report yourself with the highlights of that. Our account balance as of the end of December is $309,252, 89 cents.

302
00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:08.440
Scott Smith: and the net cash increase over the year from January first into December 30. First, we we we added an additional $73,000,

303
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.050
Scott Smith: $73,228

304
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:16.870
Scott Smith: reason for that. Substantial increase is one is we've had

305
00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:24.080
Scott Smith: a lot of success. Tremendous success. Paragraph to my expectations on collections of past delinquencies.

306
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:29.739
Scott Smith: and we spent $29,000 less than budgeted most that

307
00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:33.149
Scott Smith: for less legal work when budgeted.

308
00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:39.829
Scott Smith: and we we received an extra $3,411 in interest that wasn't budgeted before.

309
00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:52.889
Scott Smith: and I think that the not I don't. I can't confirm this exactly because the 2024 dues that were paid in 2023 might be a little bit higher than last year.

310
00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.989
Scott Smith: So that would that would kick up our cash a little bit.

311
00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.160
Problem.

312
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.529
Scott Smith: We have a real milestone moment here, folks.

313
00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:04.570
Scott Smith: all 2023 dues have been paid.

314
00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.580
Andrew Henshaw: Wow!

315
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:10.039
Scott Smith: For all practical purposes 1 one is in the mail

316
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.800
Scott Smith: hasn't been posted, but

317
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.849
Scott Smith: he confirmed it yesterday.

318
00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.120
Scott Smith: So I mean, that was, it's a

319
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:20.200
Scott Smith: when when we this this board was formed

320
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:31.229
Scott Smith: in July the accounts receivable was an early 20,000. It's it's been amazing. It's just required a lot of follow up

321
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:39.229
Scott Smith: and as far as 2024 dues, approximately 2 thirds have paid as of today.

322
00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:41.180
Scott Thompson: Good job.

323
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.810
Scott Smith: that's it.

324
00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:53.290
Scott Thompson: That's awesome. And I'll get to it in a little while. But you did. You put money in the budget for a quarterly

325
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.550
Scott Smith: yes, the block party.

326
00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:01.090
Scott Thompson: So here's what we need to do. I'll jump ahead.

327
00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:18.179
Scott Thompson: I was thinking of hosting down this call to sake a St. Patty's themed lock party. and since the we are taking money out of the budget, we should probably post it a month in advance

328
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.069
Scott Thompson: to let anybody that doesn't live here.

329
00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:26.700
Scott Thompson: Consider coming over and getting their money's worth if they want to come over for a little

330
00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:37.360
Scott Thompson: corn beef dinner. So what do you think would be a good proper time to give that notice to, so that they don't come back and tell us that the why are you spending my money and not inviting me to sell them

331
00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:39.099
Scott Thompson: more weeks? Good.

332
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.060
Scott Smith: Yeah.

333
00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.250
Scott Thompson: Okay.

334
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.729
Bo Fridh: So they plan.

335
00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.990
Scott Thompson: Maybe Andrew will even make a road trip full of corn, beef and cabbage.

336
00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:54.359
Andrew Henshaw: Wi-fi wi-fi might like it. I'm not a corn beef, guy, but

337
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.539
Scott Thompson: I gotcha I get I'll get you up.

338
00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.740
Andrew Henshaw: Good hamburger.

339
00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:01.500
Scott Smith: Greet lean beer.

340
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:05.219
Scott Thompson: Okay, Mike Sinclair, you're on the clock.

341
00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.089
mary: Alright. Let's see.

342
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:10.040
Scott Smith: Hello!

343
00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:19.989
mary: Don't really have any brand new start, so to speak. We have roughly 10 houses under construction

344
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:26.229
mary: basically 4 that remain from last year

345
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.289
mary: that it carried into this year.

346
00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:37.350
mary:  don't have any real problems with the new starts. They've moved along quite well.

347
00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.390
mary: I do have

348
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:45.270
mary: 3 lots that I'd like to talk to you guys about.

349
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:58.060
mary: We have my neighbor like 98. He's been under construction almost 2 years. still doesn't have sheet rock in place yet as well as exterior.

350
00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:59.160
mary: And then

351
00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:04.549
mary: another problem, child, we have, of course, is

352
00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:14.510
mary: lot 36. That's the wheels. That's the modular home. They've pretty much stopped construction. Looks like to me. and then

353
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:20.209
mary: a third issue I have. They don't have a house in place, but

354
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:26.910
mary: besides Scott Smith, not 76. I wrote my 4 wheeler down there yesterday, and

355
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:47.190
mary: you know that guy just left a total mess. He's got logs cut. He's got stops and branches everywhere. He still has a piece of equipment down there. But I think we need to start sending letters out and or letters and emails. So we have a paper trail. So we can put some

356
00:36:47.210 --> 00:37:05.990
mary: teeth you know, maybe start some type of fads or something. Try to get these people moving. I know when we do the CC. In ours, and all we need to put some language in there. II think maybe one year

357
00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:16.549
mary:  maybe too fast. The time period. But 18 months definitely from permit to CEO,

358
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:24.900
mary: I think once the house and complete. And again, we might need to impose some type of penalty. But

359
00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:32.170
mary: I think we definitely need to send some letters out to those 3 lots in particular. So that,

360
00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:36.970
mary: you know, we have a background history with them. I mean.

361
00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:49.290
mary: who knows what's gonna happen? A lot? 36, I mean, that's you know. But I don't think it's fair to the neighbors for that stuff to go on.

362
00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:56.190
mary: you know that amount of time. And I think we need to do something about it.

363
00:37:56.340 --> 00:38:04.960
Scott Thompson: Mike. I couldn't agree with you. I couldn't agree with you more and I have no problem being the bad guys guys. So why don't you give me the

364
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.780
Scott Thompson: send me the 3 lot numbers.

365
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.020
Scott Thompson: I will put together an email

366
00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:14.570
Scott Thompson: and then shoot it out to the group. Make sure we're not

367
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.120
Scott Thompson: Miss Nathan.

368
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.859
Scott Thompson: and if we all like the verbiage of the email.

369
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:30.280
Scott Thompson: II do think we need to get back on track. I did write it in the agenda somewhere that I think that lot 58 even with the interruptions that he had. He's working over there every day now.

370
00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:32.909
Scott Thompson: But I think he's going on 2 years now, right?

371
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:44.439
mary: Yeah, he's pushing, but you know we we had that big delay with him legal against him, so I can understand that a little bit. But

372
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:45.630
mary: you know

373
00:38:45.830 --> 00:39:01.739
mary: we need to do something about a couple of these other folks, and we course we'll get our CC in ours in place. You know. We just need to put the right terminology in there where you know, we have a little T,

374
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:04.480
mary: and you know something that we can.

375
00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.509
mary: you know, impose on people, you know.

376
00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:09.790
mary: when they, you know.

377
00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:20.270
Bo Fridh: unlock, unlock 36. I talked to Zack, the guy that moved in on the corner right next to.

378
00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.009
Bo Fridh: and he spoke with

379
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:31.689
Bo Fridh: either the owner or somebody looking to buy it. But they're trying to sell. They've got no money to complete that thing, so they're actively trying to sell it.

380
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:32.890
mary: Well.

381
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:33.810
that's

382
00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:38.110
mary: probably a good thing I didn't way over their heads on that.

383
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:47.570
Scott Thompson: They gonna build a goods. They're trying to sell. They gotta a septic system. They got a modular house that's half done. Good luck to them.

384
00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:56.229
mary: Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's a solid, granted piece of rock down there as well. One more note.

385
00:39:56.730 --> 00:40:19.099
mary: we. We got a request from Lot 47. Then I think it's natashi and Southern we need to discuss. They wanna add, I think a 2 car gravel pad for additional parking. I think I send it to you, Scott, in it. Maybe that was going to be one of my questions. Zoom.

386
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:23.920
Scott Thompson: it's not exactly what he's looking for. I talked to him

387
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.360
Scott Thompson: yesterday.

388
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:30.889
mary: He has a severely steep driveway. Yeah. He thinks that he can

389
00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:37.490
Scott Thompson: put a gravel to car Lot up by the street, and I told him that that's not his property.

390
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:43.100
mary: How much, how much of the property from the street frontages is is

391
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.579
Scott Thompson: the easement for the county.

392
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:58.389
mary: It it it depends on for a lot in a lot of areas. But yeah, it's usually in the 12 to 15 foot range. And yeah, that's

393
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:09.499
mary: let's see grass. So yeah, that's county right away. He he can't go inside that. Yeah. So II told him no, as of right now, but I'd look into it.

394
00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:15.369
Scott Thompson: I also told him that if we did have any ice situations

395
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:20.049
Scott Thompson: that he could park a car up in that.

396
00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:23.480
Scott Thompson: Whatever you want to call that turnaround spot. That's

397
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:26.560
Scott Thompson: over by that jiffy, John.

398
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:35.509
Scott Thompson: we don't have a cul de sac, but it's a it's some type of turnaround. So I told him. I said, if he wants to keep his car off the road.

399
00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.450
Scott Thompson: We would let him park there during ice storms. Only

400
00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.340
mary: gotcha.

401
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.260
mary: Well, that sounds

402
00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:51.109
Scott Thompson: Yup, so don't worry about getting back to him. I told him he cannot put any gravel temporary driveway up by the street.

403
00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:56.210
Bo Fridh: So is that your neighbor, Scott Scott, is that your neighbor?

404
00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:01.900
mary: Yeah, that driveway is hilarious.

405
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:10.410
Scott Thompson: so he realizes that we'll see how he does during the ice storms, or I wouldn't even want to get on that in a rainstorm.

406
00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:17.440
Scott Thompson: You know, yoders has to deliver here with a record. A record comes with him. It pulls him back up the hill.

407
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.340
Scott Thompson: It's possible.

408
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.150
mary:  yeah.

409
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:26.180
Scott Thompson: okay, I appreciate it. Let's see

410
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:32.049
Scott Smith: that one, Scott, the I'm looking at the Polygon map

411
00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:38.570
Scott Smith: that Andrew put together the Corny County, and it looks probably about 15 feet off of the asphalt.

412
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:49.529
Scott Smith: you know. So it's that. That is, something wouldn't work across the street. It's a different story. But it's yeah, like I said, they all very. I figures close 15 feet.

413
00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:54.129
Scott Smith: Yup, yup, so that's a no go. I told them right now until the years.

414
00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:59.430
Scott Thompson: if anything changes. So he was good. With that he appreciate me reaching out to him.

415
00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:04.130
Scott Smith: And then one other comment on as you're preparing that email.

416
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:15.230
Scott Smith: you know I will, I will check. I'll make it an action mind to check on this. But II think I agree with all all of you, that the Ccr's and bylaws need to be a lot clear

417
00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:20.640
Scott Smith: on this issues of construction completion. And then.

418
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:32.790
Scott Smith: oh, absolutely. But if there is vague language in there to have it done in a year. And there is vague language in there that that we we could actually clean it up and charge.

419
00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.229
Scott Thompson: Oh, we're gonna

420
00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:35.230
Scott Smith: yeah.

421
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:42.579
Scott Thompson: that's very important that people can't take 3 years to complete a house. That's not. That's not fair to your neighbors.

422
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:44.900
mary: No, sir.

423
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:54.859
Scott Smith: So I just mentioned that. So we're going to put some good teeth into that one definitely.

424
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.249
mary: Yeah, my mother and I,

425
00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:59.619
mary: and try to stay. I mean.

426
00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:15.959
mary: some type of terminology. We're Bar Barnum's aren't allowed as well. Type homes cause typically, those are associated with people that work out of their house typically construction

427
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.049
mary: construction type people

428
00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:29.390
mary: which I am, but but I mean we will. We. We don't want trucks rather than not, you know, running a business. So

429
00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:47.350
mary: the thing is the strange thing about it. The one situation we got up there. The guys got all the huge doors up there in his boat, sits outside his campus. It's outside, so I don't know what he has since storage in there, but so

430
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:49.439
Scott Thompson: got it going on.

431
00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:52.800
mary: Yeah, I guess.

432
00:44:55.220 --> 00:45:03.989
Scott Thompson: Alright, John, if I could take the lead on your stealing your thunder here, I wanna throw something out at you. I think we've all realized. And

433
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.590
Scott Thompson: talking to residents one after another after another.

434
00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:08.900
Scott Thompson: Nobody could

435
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:14.339
Scott Thompson: that I've spoke to is given a rats. You know. What about the clubhouse? So

436
00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.250
Scott Thompson: I'm I'm gonna throw out.

437
00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:30.310
Scott Thompson: I'd like to give John Beech the right to get an appraisal. I think it's gonna cost us 6 or $700 to get the clubhouse appraised.

438
00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:43.450
Scott Thompson: and then once we get it appraised. We're gonna put together a two-step survey pre-standing survey out to the residents. We're gonna tell them

439
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:53.380
Scott Thompson: what the clubhouses were. The issues with the clubhouse. What it would take approximately to fix it? Or

440
00:45:53.410 --> 00:46:03.870
Scott Thompson: do we want to take the money and expand the boatyard? Possible playgrounds, possible pickle ball courts, so given every everybody a number of space fixing the

441
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:10.619
Scott Thompson: run entrance and consider opening the back gate at some capacity.

442
00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:15.769
jb_ad: So let me just let me just make sure that I understand what you're asking me to do.

443
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:19.690
jb_ad: we're gonna we're gonna get an appraisal for the the land

444
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:23.479
jb_ad: and the building complete as one

445
00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:33.529
jb_ad: to put up for sale, possibly, or present to the homeowners, possibly in a survey. So in a freestanding survey

446
00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:46.070
jb_ad: right we already have an idea what it's gonna cost to fix it. It's anywhere from 50 to $75,000, which would be an assessment.

447
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:48.140
jb_ad: Right? So

448
00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:52.900
jb_ad:  yeah, I can. I can do that. I know that.

449
00:46:53.090 --> 00:47:00.709
jb_ad: I know Alicia Keys is a realtor. She might be of some help. I'm if I can get her information. Maybe she can kind of give me a round about idea without

450
00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:07.049
jb_ad: having to go to a formal appraisal. But I'm sure we will. so why don't you do this?

451
00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:22.279
Scott Thompson: Shoot us a number on how much you need to spend to get that done, and then we will all approve of you spending that money. Once we find out it's not out of the wheelhouse of what we want to commit to. It's probably a minimum of 600.

452
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:28.160
jb_ad: So it's just part of our moving forward pro process. So does everybody agree on that?

453
00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:44.819
Scott Smith: II would agree with that. And the point is, we're listed for sale. But it would. I think we'd need more than just to gut billing. We need an official appraisal money and get a real appraiser in here. It's gonna do the job right, and have something that

454
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:48.780
Scott Thompson: if somebody wants to make us an offer, it's something we can use as a document.

455
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:56.550
Scott Smith: This week we received an unsolicited offer for that property.

456
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:03.259
Scott Smith: but 2 $215,750 from a some development company, north Carolina.

457
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:12.010
Scott Smith: I think it's a scam. We won't respond to it.

458
00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:18.570
Scott Smith: And also the lot adjacent to 19 is currently listed for $399,000.

459
00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:22.369
jb_ad: Do not wait lot 19,

460
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.400
mary: about 20 or

461
00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:37.370
mary: 20. I'll tell you which one? It's 21. I know. 21. I think it's 21, yeah, 99,000. 400,000. Yup

462
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:50.039
Scott Smith: almost kind of narrow entry.

463
00:48:50.100 --> 00:49:10.620
Scott Smith: Yes, Harbor, that's what I'm trying to. I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to figure out what's going on. It's, it's it's it's it's, it's, it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's not

464
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:11.950
Scott Smith: equivalent.

465
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:18.819
Scott Smith: But it's it's a half. Acre, smaller worth. And it's listed for $100,000 higher.

466
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.910
mary: 491,000, yeah.

467
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:26.299
Scott Smith: 59, I think, wasn't sold for 5 99.

468
00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:30.710
jb_ad: That's a Badabo Sweeney's sister owns it.

469
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:32.710
Bo Fridh: Which which lot is that?

470
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:48.500
jb_ad: Yeah.

471
00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.639
jb_ad: Yeah. 5 5 plus

472
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:51.930
mary: yeah.

473
00:49:55.170 --> 00:50:02.920
Scott Smith: So there, so that we're looking at some serious coin to do what's right at the boat yard. Other things

474
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:09.519
jb_ad: I actually spoke with my builder, and she said she would be interested in buying it, but she would not.

475
00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:18.650
jb_ad: she would not tear that existing structure down. No, I don't think so. Somebody can still make that work.

476
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:21.500
Scott Thompson: Yeah. definitely.

477
00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:32.809
Scott Smith: without drawing up question. Have one question for Mike Sinclair on this. So the it's part of the septic field system. But it it it so is it, I believe.

478
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:40.610
Scott Smith: but but it was built before the septic fuel is even done. So I guess

479
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:47.620
mary: some kind of septic system down there probably

480
00:50:47.880 --> 00:51:01.010
mary: 500, I would think a 500 gallon maximum. For all we know, 55 55 gallon.

481
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.179
Bo Fridh: That could be problematic. Yeah.

482
00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:06.110
jb_ad: Be able to research on the county records.

483
00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:20.289
mary: Yeah. 0 bedroom facility.

484
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:26.600
Scott Smith: Somebody keeps. Somebody keeps getting in it, though. The window

485
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:31.010
Bo Fridh: 2 or 3 times. I think somebody's sleeping in there, or something I don't know.

486
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:32.820
Scott Thompson: Wow!

487
00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:38.460
Andrew Henshaw: If if we're gonna send this as part of the a survey.

488
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:51.050
Andrew Henshaw: then. I expect you were going to have ask them about some of the alternatives or things to do with the money that they're proceeds right?

489
00:51:51.090 --> 00:52:02.420
Andrew Henshaw: So do we need to do some. Get some estimates for those items. Also other things. I'll send you a spreadsheet. I've already got ballpark figures on all that for the bill yard.

490
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:10.439
Scott Thompson: but we also need to find out if Lot Number One does anybody have a relationship with a guy that owns those 3 spots?

491
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.059
Bo Fridh: Is that toll-free?

492
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:21.690
Bo Fridh: I've met him once, but I've got 0 relationship with them. I wouldn't know, you know.

493
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:24.120
Bo Fridh: ran into them today.

494
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:31.300
Scott Thompson: Somebody told me at 1 point that he would be willing to give up Lot Number One because he does not have access to it.

495
00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:41.089
Scott Thompson: and I didn't know if we would need to purchase that, or we would just sign it over to us. So I'd like to reach out to them

496
00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:48.039
Scott Thompson: before we do this. before we get to the point of someone listing that property and doing a survey.

497
00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:57.109
Scott Thompson: because that I think it probably cost at least $50,000 to knock down those trees. Fill in that gully, and make that an expansion of the boatyard.

498
00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:01.900
Scott Thompson: So, Andrew, if you have a phone number for him.

499
00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:09.540
Bo Fridh:  yeah, okay.

500
00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:12.990
Andrew Henshaw: pull it up.

501
00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:28.920
Scott Thompson: So, John, you're gonna take the lead on, get an appraisal. Absolutely. So here's what I want you to do. Get a phone number, get a price on a proper appraisal

502
00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:35.469
Scott Thompson: shoot it out to the board and we'll make a motion to move forward with that expense.

503
00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:50.269
Scott Thompson: You got that. Okay? Now, what I'd like to do is I would wrap up like to wrap up the rest of the meeting with commenting on the great job that Andrew did by putting together that

504
00:53:50.520 --> 00:54:04.979
Scott Thompson: survey monkey on that nice format. So, Andrew, if you could expand on that a little bit and then let me know if you're gonna be able to take The other comments are added by the team members to

505
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:09.500
Scott Thompson: start moving forward so we can think about getting this out to the residents.

506
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:11.630
Andrew Henshaw: Sure.

507
00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.699
Andrew Henshaw: So the I don't know if I

508
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:20.380
Andrew Henshaw: feedback let me see if I can share this.

509
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:38.800
Andrew Henshaw: You're all seeing that. Yeah, yes, okay, good. So I was testing out a couple of different options I mentioned survey king and server here, and server, monkey and

510
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.200
Andrew Henshaw: and

511
00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:45.989
Andrew Henshaw: doing the editing. I really like the Super Survey hero, so

512
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:50.929
Andrew Henshaw: we can get a monthly we can. We can get a monthly pass.

513
00:54:51.050 --> 00:55:00.989
Andrew Henshaw: or we can pay for a year, and it's cheaper. So it's $35 per month. $25 a month if we do a year a yearly thing this is what it

514
00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:11.390
Andrew Henshaw: I did a few I can only do until we actually pay for it. I can only do up 10. It would look something like this. And then each one of those sections that I had

515
00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:19.749
Andrew Henshaw: that we had. That I have little yellow boxes around each one of those would be a separate page. It would look like this. And if you're looking at all

516
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:21.500
Andrew Henshaw: on a

517
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:25.909
Andrew Henshaw: but when it would look like that, so they do a nice job, I think, with it.

518
00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:34.799
Andrew Henshaw: And so, Scott, whichever one way you'd like to do it. If we're gonna do. If we think we're gonna do multiple surveys, you know, in the year.

519
00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:44.479
Andrew Henshaw: I'd like to make a motion to, I'd like to make a move motion at least by one year, so we can be aggressive on some of the things we would like to do.

520
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:45.470
Andrew Henshaw: Okay.

521
00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:57.479
Andrew Henshaw: So, Scott, how do you just send you the link to it? And and or do you want me to just pay for myself and then get reimbursed or no. I've got a debit card if you send it to me.

522
00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:06.739
Scott Thompson: Alright super, so do we want to make a motion that. If it's so, what would 25

523
00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:08.600
Andrew Henshaw: 360.

524
00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:12.609
Scott Thompson: So that's make a motion that will spend

525
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:17.529
Andrew Henshaw: under 400 h, and I'll go ahead and just do this as soon as I get that link.

526
00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:20.069
Scott Thompson: Yeah, right? But it'll be under 4

527
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:23.699
Bo Fridh: to make a motion to go ahead with it.

528
00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.310
jb_ad: Okay, I'll second it

529
00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:27.110
Andrew Henshaw: works.

530
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:35.549
Andrew Henshaw: so I'll go ahead and put the rest of what we have. Then the last version that I had, and I'll check to make sure that I'm not missing anybody's comments.

531
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:41.100
Andrew Henshaw: and then then I can share this survey with you, and you can. Everybody can look at it.

532
00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:46.170
Andrew Henshaw: There, live essentially. I'll I'll do that as well.

533
00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:54.610
Scott Thompson: I love to look, and I think the residents will appreciate the the simplicity of this versus that old

534
00:56:55.190 --> 00:57:02.400
Andrew Henshaw: mess that we used to work with

535
00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:06.189
Andrew Henshaw: legal review. Do we need?

536
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:11.889
Andrew Henshaw: I don't know if anybody still on the board still wants that or not.

537
00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:12.800
Andrew Henshaw: but

538
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:19.150
Andrew Henshaw: it's it is just a survey kind of disclaimers on it, saying, This is just a survey.

539
00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:33.640
Scott Thompson: So the way I see this is it's There is nothing going live yet that needs to be presented to legal. So once we get done cleaning up the survey, I think the

540
00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:38.030
Scott Thompson: maybe we visit taking that to legal to

541
00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:42.849
mary: what are your thoughts? Yeah, it's done.

542
00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.200
Scott Smith: It depends what we're asking.

543
00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.219
mary: We're just sure

544
00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:54.579
Scott Smith: asking for opinion that if if what we're gonna do with information, I guess.

545
00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:59.989
Scott Smith: So the our lawyers are very, very easy to work with.

546
00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:11.650
Scott Thompson: I shot them something that she said. It's gonna take you 2 weeks to make an appointment, or did you just shoot me over what your question is. So I'd like to shoot them. Our final survey

547
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:20.160
Scott Thompson: and just, Sarah, we okay to present this to the residents as a survey only. or feedback without a

548
00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:25.599
Scott Thompson: going. Then we'll tell them we're gonna circle back, live. Once we finalize it through the residence.

549
00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:27.740
jb_ad: Scott, what's the attorney's name

550
00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:32.530
Scott Thompson: enough to look it up? It's on an email. I don't know him that. Well.

551
00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:42.200
Bo Fridh: since we're referencing the CC. In ours that this stuff is addressing issues.

552
00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:44.530
Bo Fridh: If it's going to cost

553
00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:49.369
Bo Fridh: 500 bucks, 800 bucks to get a legal review upfront. Why not?

554
00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:55.310
Scott Thompson: I'll send it to them. They may not ask for that. They just may look it over and say, you guys are

555
00:58:55.620 --> 00:59:04.800
Scott Thompson: within your boundaries of shooting the survey out to your residence for feedback before you actually put it into effect.

556
00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:08.159
Scott Thompson: They'll answer that question for me.

557
00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:09.120
Bo Fridh: Okay.

558
00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.980
Andrew Henshaw: well, I don't know if I can stop sharing, so unfortunately.

559
00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:17.070
Andrew Henshaw: my zoom window is all kind of

560
00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:19.559
Bo Fridh: now we're we're back to the regular zoom window.

561
00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:28.699
Andrew Henshaw: Oh, okay, good. So, Andrea, if you wanna if you want to circle back to everybody. And I think, Scott, you have some feedback and maybe somebody else. So

562
00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:30.450
Scott Thompson: let's make sure that

563
00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:35.759
Scott Thompson: if before we complete this phase that anybody gets their last minute input.

564
00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:45.750
Scott Thompson: But I appreciate the Andrew taking the lead on that, and I will get that. I will pay for that and let you know as soon as the

565
00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:50.830
Scott Thompson: the transaction goes through, so you can start working on it.

566
00:59:51.030 --> 01:00:01.120
Scott Smith: II don't know if you need to make the motion, Scott, you you started to to purchase this software, but I think you have unanimous consent. That consensus, I think, here, do you? Wanna

567
01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:05.470
Scott Thompson: yep. I appreciate it.

568
01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.399
Scott Thompson: But you're okay with me putting on the debit card. Right?

569
01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:20.160
Scott Smith: Yeah, I'm I'm okay. I'm just. I'm saying that you started to make the motion. So if you wanted to finish motion, I think all

570
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:23.360
mary: Hi!

571
01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:29.959
Scott Thompson: Alright. So we are approaching the 1 h window, which is my goal of 59 min.

572
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:33.389
Scott Thompson: Does anybody have anything else to add?

573
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:44.979
Bo Fridh: Just gonna throw out something I heard again talking to the new guy Zack up there, you know, Scott, I know Scott Thompson, and anybody living

574
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.240
Bo Fridh: down towards the Covent

575
01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:54.229
Bo Fridh: where the community center is getting out of there when the water is low is

576
01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.070
Bo Fridh: a real pain in the ass.

577
01:00:56.430 --> 01:01:05.760
Bo Fridh: Apparently. Zack, called Duke Power and said, You guys gonna do any dredging over there, so that although all the people that live over

578
01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:18.309
Bo Fridh: at our end down here and across the way over at the hideaway Cove can actually use their boats to get out to the main water, and apparently he was told, the Duke will dredge it

579
01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:22.560
jb_ad: if collectively, people come up with $50,000,

580
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:32.070
Scott Thompson: so I really don't care. But here's the deal with dredging. I I was in charge of a dredging project down in

581
01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:36.490
Scott Thompson: Stewart, Florida. and it came to

582
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:43.570
Scott Thompson: about a hundred 25,000 h. So if they'll do that whole stretch for $50,000,

583
01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:55.999
Scott Thompson: and we have 40 residents from that far point all the way back to the next neighborhood over. it's actually not a bad number to divide that by

584
01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.119
Scott Thompson: 35, 40 people.

585
01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.850
Bo Fridh: Yeah, that's what Zach said. And you know, I'm kind of like.

586
01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:08.169
Bo Fridh: I'm not on the water. So it doesn't impact me one way or the other, really, except that I'm using somebody's back now.

587
01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:20.149
Scott Thompson: So what I would do is up. I did this in a joining neighborhood down in Stewart. I got every one of them to they actually ended up paying 3 quarters of it because it only impacted

588
01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:21.710
Scott Thompson: like

589
01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:29.890
Scott Thompson: 3 city blocks of our resident where they had another canal that went in there. So I don't. I research

590
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:41.319
Scott Thompson: I'll get with Zack and see if he wants to. Tell me who we talk to at Duke. and I'll look into putting together a proposal of dredging, and then I'll start

591
01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:45.209
Scott Thompson: soliciting the neighborhood across the street. What's the name of that neighborhood.

592
01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:46.950
mary: Heidi Cole.

593
01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:55.490
Scott Thompson: Okay, I'll reach out to their president over there and see if if they're interested in going in on us with a investment.

594
01:02:55.610 --> 01:03:00.210
jb_ad: Yeah, the waters, the waters actually pretty much deeper on that side of the cove.

595
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:03.929
Scott Thompson: Yeah. But if they can't get out, we're all in the same boat.

596
01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:04.950
jb_ad: Yeah.

597
01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:12.170
Bo Fridh: yeah. Right now, apparently the water levels pretty good. You can't see that mud island out there right now this week.

598
01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:15.630
Scott Thompson: The way Duke puts that water up and down. It's crazy.

599
01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:19.060
Scott Thompson: I have one more. I have one more topic.

600
01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.469
Scott Thompson: I'm not gonna mention any residents names, but

601
01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:29.029
Scott Thompson: there is a dog or 2 that are in this neighborhood. That bark all day long

602
01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:33.779
Scott Thompson: all day long is very loud from my house.

603
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:44.920
Scott Thompson: So what do we do? We wanna call the homeowner and and give them a a friendly warning that we're thinking about making a phone call to

604
01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:48.010
Scott Thompson: the animal control? Or how should we handle that?

605
01:03:48.150 --> 01:04:06.069
Bo Fridh: That? That would probably be a good idea. II met with Officer Tonya Spalty after I got bitten by that. Probably that same home owners, dogs, one of those dogs. She's more than happy to either join in a Zoom Meeting, or if we get together somewhere, come over and talk about all the things related to that.

606
01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:08.969
Bo Fridh: But I know the next door neighbor to that person has

607
01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:13.579
Bo Fridh: the same concerns you do, Scott, about the barking and

608
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:15.490
Bo Fridh: her suggestion.

609
01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:22.779
Bo Fridh: if you want to take it to the step of contacting them, is just keeping a log days, you know the dates and times

610
01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:25.170
Bo Fridh: when it's pronounced.

611
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:32.060
Bo Fridh: and call them, they will pay a visit. But to your point it might be a good idea if you touch base with them.

612
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:40.069
Scott Thompson: Could you do me a favor? The the person that you're speaking to about your matter? Could you ask them if there is an ordinance that

613
01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.400
Scott Thompson: Oh, motor service there is.

614
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:51.820
Bo Fridh: Yeah, yeah, you can't have barking dogs outside bothering neighbors. Can you see if you can get that in writing, and I will. First give them a friendly

615
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:55.410
Scott Thompson: live, and then I will email the verbiage on that.

616
01:04:55.650 --> 01:05:04.220
Bo Fridh: I tell you what I she gave me a document that has all sorts of information about everything that has to do with panel. You know animal ordinances in the county. I will.

617
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:08.770
Bo Fridh: It's probably in there I'll find it. I'll do a screenshot or whatever, and shoot it to you.

618
01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:13.220
Scott Thompson: Okay, so I'm gonna document yesterday all day

619
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:16.810
Scott Thompson: I'm gonna call him this weekend and just give him a friendly

620
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:26.729
Scott Thompson: call to call person. Let him know that we're aware of Neighbor, several neighbors complaining about it. And I'm gonna give him the option of

621
01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:30.560
Scott Thompson: stopping it. And I'll also document the dates.

622
01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:33.389
Scott Thompson: and then we'll see what comes out of it

623
01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.879
Scott Thompson: as a little girl.

624
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:37.940
jb_ad: Okay.

625
01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:47.619
Bo Fridh: what's that? Yeah. It's a it's a little tender to the touch in the spot. But the the P. The puncture, all 4 puncture wounds have healed up.

626
01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:56.560
jb_ad: that's good.

627
01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:03.309
Bo Fridh: No, hey! They! They quarantine. The dog for 10 days didn't die so apparently. Rabies.

628
01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.630
Scott Thompson: He's been out back barking the whole time.

629
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:10.090
Bo Fridh: I'm I'm walking the neighborhood with a can of bear spray. Now

630
01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:15.530
Scott Thompson: I gotcha alright. I'm gonna get to work on these follow ups. Does anybody got anything else?

631
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:19.840
Bo Fridh: I do not want

632
01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:29.389
Andrew Henshaw: Scott. I'm gonna I'm sending you the the login information if you wouldn't, if it's alright if you just use my current login because I've already built

633
01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:43.180
Scott Thompson: otherwise the survey goes away. Okay, Andrew, Andrew, I sent you that list, master

634
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:47.410
Andrew Henshaw: the pictures perfect. Thank you.

635
01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:53.900
Scott Thompson: Okay, hold off until we get those 3 topics complete. The recommended serve vendors and the

636
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:57.579
Scott Thompson: the open seat, and we'll get them all sent out together.

637
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:02.380
Scott Thompson: Okay, motion to close the meeting.

638
01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.170

mary: become somebody.

658
01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:50.809
mary: There's no way they can come up with the money to finish it. I don't know.

659
01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:57.610
mary:  understand why people don't do research or whatever ahead of time.

660
01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:03.519
mary: what? They didn't know that they thought that they ordered this mobile home. And it comes all done.
